# File Processing Script

## Overview
This Python script reads a text file specified by the user, converts its content to uppercase, and writes the modified content to a new file. It includes robust error handling to manage cases where the input file does not exist or cannot be read, as well as handling write errors.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter the filename to process.
- Validates file existence and read permissions.
- Converts the entire file content to uppercase.
- Writes the modified content to a new file prefixed with `modified_`.
- Provides clear success and error messages.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Place the script in your working directory.
3. Run the script from the command line or an IDE:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

4. When prompted, enter the name of the file you want to process (including extension).
5. If the file exists and is readable, a new file named `modified_<original_filename>` will be created with the uppercase content.

## Example

If you have a file named `example.txt` containing:

```
Hello, World!
This is a test.
```

After running the script and entering `example.txt`, a new file `modified_example.txt` will be created containing:

```
HELLO, WORLD!
THIS IS A TEST.
```

## Error Handling

- If the input file does not exist, the script will display:
  ```
  Error: The file 'filename' does not exist.
  ```
- If the input file cannot be read due to permission issues or other errors, the script will display:
  ```
  Error: The file 'filename' cannot be read.
  ```
- If the script cannot write to the output file, it will display:
  ```
  Error: Could not write to file 'modified_filename'.
  ```
